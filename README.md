# ArchLinux
Arch installations on laptop and PC

I have never used Linux before.  I decided to change that after being annoyed with Windows.  These are the issues.  

Upon investigating, I discovered my fonts folder was consuming a significant amount of space. Instead of opting for a drive repartition, I chose a different approach. I created a fonts folder on my larger main drive (a TB in size), transferred the contents from the overflowing home drive fonts folder, and established a symbolic link between them. This solution bypassed the need for drive partitioning and resolved the issue smoothly.
